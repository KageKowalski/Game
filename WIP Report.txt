* Window class has a function called construct(). Inside of construct(), there is the line:
m_RenderWindow.setFramerateLimit(60). This sets the newly constructed window's maximum framerate
clamp to 60 FPS. Josh said this isn't always optimal based on hardware, so eventually this
function will need to be altered for a smarter FPS cap based on the particular hardware being used.
